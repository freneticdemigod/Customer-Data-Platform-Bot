    "title": "What is Vault?",
    "url": "https://docs.lytics.com/docs/what-is-vault",
    "content": "IntroductionVault is a centralized hub for managing security and other administrative features in Lytics. It provides a single place for Lytics admins to access and change their key security features and user permissions, regardless of product. This means that the controls set in Vault apply to Conductor, Decision Engine, Cloud Connect, and any other products associated with your Lytics account.Take a quick tour of Lytics Vault.Navigating VaultVault is comprised of the following sections:Account Usage- an overview of your general account quota usage related to event consumption.Account Settings- view and change necessary administrative settings and details of your account. These are sectioned into the following categories.Account DetailsJavaScript TagLytics APIContentSecuritySchemaUsers- view a list of users accessing your Lytics account, change their details or permissions, remove a user, or invite a new user to the account.SecurityAccess Tokens- view and manage a list of Lytics API access tokens. New tokens can be provisioned with specific permissions.Authorizations- create, edit, view, and delete authorizations within Lytics. Authorizations are credentials to third parties that enable the necessary scopes and permissions for data import and export jobs to run.Account SetupJavaScript Tag- learn how to install the Lytics JavaScript tag and validate the installation.Who can access Vault?Vault is focused primarily on account admins or those that have permission to administer settings, user access, etc. Based upon these permissions, your experience in Vault may vary, and all sections outlined above may not be available.📘If you are unable to access a section please reach out to your account administrator to request those adjusted permissions.In general, Admins will be able to access all areas. Data Managers, Campaign Managers, Experience Managers, and Goal Managers can access the Authorizations section to manage the credentials for their jobs and experiences. Finally, all Lytics users, regardless of role, should have access to view the JavaScript tag installation page under Account Setup, and they should be able to view their user profile where they can change details such as their Name, Email Address, Phone Number (for two-factor authentication) and change their password. Your user profile will be accessible under the main Lytics navigation under \"Manage My Profile.\"Notable ChangesFor existing customers, slight changes will impact your day-to-day management activities.Product SwitcherVault will be available directly from the primary product switcher at the top left of your Lytics interface. This will be your primary access point for account management from now on.Account UsageOur account usage data and quota meters received a much-needed facelift. The usage metrics act as the Vault \"dashboard\" for admin users.Account SettingsAccount setting sections are now accessible through the main navigation. These settings have received a minor facelift update. The form controls for multi-text fields have been slightly updated for a more standard user experience. In addition, users are now prompted to save or discard their changes when navigating away from these pages with unsaved settings.UsersThe user list is now sortable and filterable based on name, email, who invited them, and how long they've been a Lytics user. Each user has a page to view their details and roles. In Vault, in addition to assigning new roles, an administrator can edit any user's name and email address.The user invite form is now on its page to improve the flow and experience of inviting users. Roles are now sorted into two categories - Admin or Custom Roles. An admin inherently has access to everything, while custom roles give a finer-grain definition of what the user can access. The details on each role are shown in a tooltip when you hover over the role name.Access TokensThe access tokens list is now sortable and filterable based on the name, description, the creator of the token, or when/if it has expired. You can now view additional details about the access tokens you've already created, such as the roles assigned, when it was made, and when it will expire. In addition, new access tokens can now be assigned as an admin or with any combination of more granular access roles.AuthorizationsAuthorizations are now to be created and updated only in Vault. You will still be able to utilize the auths you create in Vault in other products, but for example, when creating a job in Conductor or Decision Engine, if you don't see an authorization you want to use for that job, you will be linked into the authorizations wizard within Vault to create the auth.JavaScript Tag InstallationThis page remains unchanged, with simple styling changes and updated links to our documentation for troubleshooting.Updatedover 1 year ago",

    "title": "Identity Resolution",
    "url": "https://docs.lytics.com/docs/identity-resolution",
    "content": "IntroductionIdentity Resolution is a crucial component of customer communication. Establishing and maintaining a well-defined identity resolution strategy is essential, but it can be overwhelming to get started. Several challenges may arise, such as limited and outdated customer data, data silos, technical difficulties, in-flexibility, consistency, compliance, and maintenance.Lytics offers a solution that powers brands' identity resolution strategies by aggregating data from disparate sources, defining a standardized customer schema, unifying disparate sources, surfacing individual consumer profiles, enabling better understanding, segmentation, and activation across channel tools, ensuring control, visibility, flexibility, security, privacy, and compliance, and maximizing match rates and accuracy across activation channels.The goal is to construct complex consumer profiles and maintain accurate and compliant user profiles as your brand evolves. Defining the relationship between consumer identifiers is a necessary first step in surfacing unified user profiles that enable your brand to create the best consumer engagements while meeting evolving compliance requirements. To achieve this, we've broken our approach into three components:Our ApproachDefine: Relationships Between IdentifiersProfile definition is the first step in surfacing unified user profiles that enable your brand to create the best consumer engagements while meeting evolving compliance requirements.To build a strong identity resolution strategy, three key questions must be answered:How important is accuracy?How do you define and manage the strength of each identifier to ensure profiles are materialized properly?How can the materialized profiles be analyzed and delivered to other tools?Construct: Complex ProfilesData is messy. Lytics' Profile Materialization provides a necessary cleansing & polishing layer atop the defined resolution strategy. This ensures what is surfaced is accurate and accessible and enables your team to accelerate impact.Answering the following two key questions guarantee profiles represent the ideal marketable entity:What attributes should be surfaced on profiles for segmentation, and does the data need to be normalized at all?What rules should be used to maintain profile integrity?Maintain: Accurate & Compliant ProfilesOver time profiles will bloat, attributes will become stale, and use cases become more complex. If unmanaged, a quality identity strategy will begin breaking down the moment it is implemented.Lytics prevents your identity strategy from breakdown through a set of powerful tools focused on ensuring the following profile health-related questions have concrete answers:How can you validate the health of your ID resolution strategy over time?What is the process for managing consent?How long is a profile relevant if it no longer has a means of being updated?What is the life expectancy of expirable IDs, such as browser cookies?Advanced ConceptsThe Lytics Identity GraphBehind each Lytics profile is an identity graph.  This graph represents connections between pieces of data observed across multiple sources or even within a single source.To create (or update) profiles from a data stream, the stream must contain one or moreidentity keysthat identify distinct users with which to associate the data.  When data is observed for a given identity key, it stores the relevant profile metadata in an object called anidentity fragment.  When there's evidence on a data stream  that two keys or fragments should be connectedWhen evidence on a data stream shows that two keys or fragments identify the same real-world entity, those fragments become connected in the same identity graph.  Some identity graphs are significant and represent complex relationships in the data. In contrast, other identity graphs are small and describe a small interaction, like an anonymous cookie from a single-visit, incognito browser.Graph MechanicsAs you learned from the identity resolution overview, a profile comprises one or more identity fragments.  Many profiles start as singletons – new data is observed on a data stream. That event's identifier keys create any necessary identity fragments and store the event's associated data on that fragment.However, we're not satisfied with several singletons – our objective is to stitch data sources together by linking the appropriate underlying fragments.  Stitching occurs when we observe two identifiers in a single event.  A common stitching event is a newsletter signup, where the email address from the newsletter form is linked to the cookie from their web activity and creates a link between activity from the browser on the device and any activity associated with the email address, which could eventually encompass purchases, support tickets, CRM data, etc.In graph terms, stitching creates an edge between two nodes representing two identity fragments.  If we wanted to retrieve a profile associated with an email address, we would retrieve all of the fragments with edges or connections to other fragments.  From there, we'd want to find all of the connections to those other fragments, and so on, until there are no more connections to follow.  Following one fragment to another is calledtraversal.  The full set of fragments that are found to have connections to the initial fragment are calledneighbors.In Lytics, default graph limits cap the number of traversals allowed for an individual profile at 50 and cap the number of neighbors allowed at 50.  Changing these values can create different sets of user profiles over the same data set and should not be adjusted lightly.  To change these values for your data, please contactLytics support.Identity KeysAs we traverse identity graphs, we'll quickly find that identity fragments and their corresponding identity keys are not all created equal. An identifier's strength must contribute proportionally to its influence on identity resolution.For example, you have email addresses and cookies as identity keys.  Generally, a user identified with an email address can have multiple cookie values (from different devices, browsers, periods, etc.).  Imagine hosting a promotional, in-person event and having multiple tablets collecting participants' email addresses.  Depending on how those email addresses are collected (most likely through an online form), you'll likely have one cookie associated withmanyemail addresses.Field TypesField types for Identity Keys can be either a string or a string set.  String sets are a common field type for cookies since one profile is expected to have many cookie values over time.  Email addresses are not so cut-and-dry.  Some organizations will constrain profiles to have one email address, while others will allow profiles to have multiple (personal, work, etc.).  In our example of email collection via physical tablet, if the email address is a single-valued string type, we won't end up with an over-merged hairball.Using an identity key that allows for a set of values is usually a good idea to have a sensical capacity cap on the field type.  A set of cookies, for example, might have a capacity limit of 50 values.  On the other hand, a set of emails might have a capacity limit of 5 values.Identity Key RankingsThe ranking of your identity keys should reflect their reliability and their relative importance in the strategy.  In the event of a conflict in stitching and merging, higher-ranked identity keys will win.  Typically, most Lytics users configure email identifiers to be ranked higher than cookie identifiers.Imagine a scenario where email A is connected to cookies X and Y, while email B is connected to cookie Z.  If new data is observed that connects email B with cookie Y, we have aconflict, meaning that a resulting stitching between the two fragments would yield a profile with twodifferentemail fragments and violates our merge rules.The ranks of identity keys would dictate that, for the new even",

    "title": "Consent & Privacy",
    "url": "https://docs.lytics.com/docs/consent",
    "content": "IntroductionAs businesses continue to collect and utilize customer data to power their marketing efforts, obtaining, managing, and enforcing proper consent is crucial. This is important for complying with various privacy laws and regulations and maintaining trust with customers. This document will explore the importance of granularity in a consent strategy and how Lytics can assist in the consent management process. We will cover best practices to consider and provide guidance on where to get started. The following four steps will be outlined:Data Collection: How to collect consent adequately from disparate sources consistently.Profile Materialization: How to flexibly surface the state of consent to individual user profiles.Segmentation: How can the required consent rules be enforced when driving downstream campaigns?Maintenance: How to ensure that your consent strategy scales and flexes to your ongoing market conditions without fail?By following these steps, businesses can establish a solid and effective consent management strategy that respects customer privacy and builds trust.Data CollectionTo maintain compliance with data privacy regulations, businesses need a clear and flexible path for collecting consent data. Lytics offers a range of SDKs and data collection APIs to support this effort. When approaching consent data collection, it is essential to consider the following:The source of the data and any inherent limitations. Can it be real-time, or does it need to be batch?The granularity of the consent. Is this a simple boolean, on or off, or is this something more granular, like opting into a particular communication method?Additional context related to the consent that may be important for your needs. Are there specific forms that are being consented to or a unique source?To address these considerations, Lytics has developed a suggested schema to get you started. Of course, this can always be customized viaConductorto meet your specific needs.Data StructureEffective consent management requires a comprehensive set of properties that can be deployed to ensure compliance and maintain customer trust. These properties should cover various aspects of data collection, storage, and usage and provide businesses with the tools to manage consent-related data effectively.Schema PropertyDescriptionEvent NameUsing a standardized event name for consent collection provides crucial context that can be utilized through if/else rules for individual mappings. By leveraging different event names, such as \"consent-type-1\" versus \"consent-type-2,\" it becomes easier to differentiate between multiple types of consent on a single profile as events stream in and is subsequently mapped. This approach enables businesses to maintain a more granular and organized record of consent-related data.ConsentedA clear and concise confirmation, or lack thereof, reduces the possibility of accidentally mapping consent when consent has been denied or not yet collected.LocationAn optional parameter to build context around a user's location that may become important. Are they consenting to something location specific?DateAn optional parameter to build context around when consent was most recently given. Date may be important if consent is valid for a specified length of time and may help support efforts to gather consent in the event that the consent timeframe has lapsed.DocumentsThe \"documents\" array within the default schema represents additional context that can be used to specify the source of consent. For instance, this field can indicate whether the consent was given via a global site-wide agreement or a specific call to action during a purchase. While the data manager determines the values and format of this field, including this information helps ensure that critical context is not lost during execution.Examples📘We are here to help!Consent is not a one size fits all scenario. Each customers data and business goals are unique. Before deploying any of the following examples it is always recommended to consult with your Technical Account Manager or a Solutions Architect.Lytics deploys a flexible data model, and though the following is not representative of every method of collection, we've highlighted two working examples leveraging our available SDKs as a baseline:Collecting Consent via the Web: Lytics JavaScriptTagJavaScriptjstag.send({\n  \"event\": \"form-submit\",\t\n  \"consent\": {\n    \"purpose\": \"global\",\n    \"location\": \"Portland, OR\",\n    \"documents\": [\"generic-submit-form\"],\n    \"consented\": true\n  }\n})Collecting Consent via Mobile: Lytics iOS SDKLytics.shared.consent(\n  name: \"consent-1\",\n  identifiers: AnyCodable([\n    \"userid\": \"my-fake-userid-1234\"\n  ]),\n  attributes: AnyCodable([\n    \"firstName\": \"Kevin\",\n    \"lastName\": \"McCalister\"\n  ]),\n  consent: AnyCodable([\n    \"documents\": [\n      \"terms_jan_2023\",\n      \"sharing_policy_jan_2023\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"Chicago, IL\",\n    \"consented\": true\n  ])\n)📘When using Lytics SDKs, you do not have to include date within the data passed in the consent event. The timestamp of the consent event can be used to create the field and mapping for the date of consent.Profile MaterializationBuilding from the collection strategy outlined inCollecting Consent Data, we must determine how to materialize the consent-related data we've just collected to user profiles for segmentation. This can be achieved in a variety of ways. Regardless of the approach, however, it is essential to consider the level of granularity of the consent.GranularityWhen collecting consent from users, obtaining granular consent for each specific use of a customer's personal data is an important consideration. Granular consent means that customers are provided with a clear understanding of the exact purposes for which their personal data will be used and can choose to consent or withhold consent for each specific use case.For example, a business may seek granular consent from a customer to collect their email address and use it to send them promotional emails but not to share the email address with third-party partners for advertising purposes. This approach allows customers to make more informed decisions about how their personal data is used and provides greater control over their privacy.Obtaining granular consent not only requires careful planning and clear communication with customers about the specific use cases for their personal data but also a rock-solid means for enforcing an individual's consent wishes across all future touchpoints.SchemaEnforcement begins by ensuring consent wishes are accurately materialized on each user's profile. This is done by first defining consent-related attributes to be used in segmentation.Field DefinitionWhen defining profile fields, there are two primary considerations. What type of field should be used, such as astringor amapand how do you want to handle data merging when profiles are stitched?Field TypeTypeBenefitsDrawbacksMap (Recommended)A map is the most straightforward approach, allowing you to add additional context with minimum overhead. You create one field and map multiple data points to that field.During segmentation, maps may be slightly more challenging to navigate. Because the keys that are nested under the map are not part of the top-level schema, you'll need to drill into the field to build segments vs. searching at the top level.StringWhen building segments, because all consent fields would be at the top level of the schema, it may be easier to find and select the contextual data.When using a string, you can only store a single value. This represents a heavier lift during the initial setup, as you'll need to create many fields to facilitate a single consent use case.Merge OperatorType StringBecause consent is something that may change for a consumer over time, the values must represent the most recent data. As such, thelatestmerge operator is always recommended. This means that as additional data is stitched to a u",

    "title": "Client & Server Side Cookies",
    "url": "https://docs.lytics.com/docs/client-server-side-cookie-deep-dive",
    "content": "What is a CookieAn HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to a user's web browser. The browser may store the cookie and send it back to the same server with later requests. Typically, an HTTP cookie is used to tell if two requests come from the same browser—keeping a user logged in, for example. It remembers stateful information for thestatelessHTTP protocol.Cookie FlavorsFirst-partyFirst-party cookies are created by the host domain – the domain the user is visiting. These cookies are generally considered good; they help provide a better user experience and keep the session open. This means the browser can remember key information, such as items you add to shopping carts, username, and language preferences.Third-partyThird-party cookies are those created by domains other than the one the user is visiting at the time and are mainly used for tracking and online-advertising purposes. They also allow website owners to provide certain services, such as live chats.Common Cookie Use CasesSession managementLogins, shopping carts, game scores, or anything else the server should remember.PersonalizationUser preferences, themes, and other settings.TrackingRecording and analyzing user behavior.How does Lytics use cookies?Cookies are one of the preferred methods for maintaining a user identifier in the browser, both known and anonymous. This gets associated with all inbound events captured by our Javascript tag as they interact with customer websites. Specifically, our Javascript tag stores a string of digits and characters that are used as a unique ID commonly referred to as our_uidor, in some casesseeridas a first-party cookie.Creating & Managing CookiesWhere do cookies come from?Client-SideIn web development, the client-side refers to everything in a web application displayed on the client (end-user device). This includes what the user sees, such as text, images, and the rest of the UI, along with any actions an application performs within the user's browser.When someone refers to a “client-side cookie,” they are generally referring to a cookie that is created and/or managed via a common client-side programming language such as Javascript.Server SideLike with client-side, server-side means everything that happens on the server instead of on the client. In the past, nearly all business logic ran on the server-side, including rendering dynamic webpages, interacting with databases, identity authentication, and push notifications.When someone refers to a “server-side cookie,” they are generally referring to a cookie that is created and managed using one of the many common server-side programming languages such as NodeJS, PHP, Python, etc.Cookie IngredientsNameDefines the cookie name. Generally, the cookie name is the primary way of retrieving a cookie and its associated value and attributes.ValueThe stored value for the cookie. This can include any US-ASCII character excluding a control character, whitespace, double quotes, comma, semicolon, and backslash.ExpiresIndicates the maximum lifetime of the cookie as an HTTP-date timestamp. SeeDatefor the required formatting.Max-AgeIndicates the number of seconds until the cookie expires. A zero or negative number will expire the cookie immediately.DomainDefines the host to which the cookie will be sent.PathIndicates the path that must exist in the requested URL for the browser to send theCookieheader.SecureThis indicates that the cookie is sent to the server only when a request is made with theHTTPS:scheme (except on localhost) and, therefore, is more resistant toman-in-the-middle attacks.HttpOnlyForbids JavaScript from accessing the cookie, for example, through theDocument.cookieproperty. Note that a cookie created withHttpOnlywill still be sent with JavaScript-initiated requests, for example, when callingXMLHttpRequest.send()orfetch(). This mitigates attacks against cross-site scripting (XSS).SameSiteControls whether or not a cookie is sent with cross-origin requests, providing some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks (CSRF).Who’s taking away my cookies?!?In June 2017, Apple introduced a new privacy feature calledIntelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP). This same feature was officially released in September 2017 with Safari 12 and iOS 11. Since then, the ITP has evolved and introduced several subsequent versions leading us to the current state (as of July 2022), which has many impacts on marketing but most notably:ITP blocks all third-party cookies by default. (ITP 1.0/1.1)ITP can grant exceptions to third-party cookies with Storage API. (ITP 2.0)ITP caps all first-party cookies set with JavaScript to 7 days or 24 hours. (ITP 2.1/2.2)ITP caps first-party cookies set by the server using CNAME cloaking to 7 days. (ITP 2.3)As a result of the privacy and security efforts in general other browsers such as Mozilla’s Firefox(ETP) and Google Chrome have followed suit in announcing and/or implementing their security and tracking protocols, which continue to impact tools such as third and first-party cookies that have long been a staple in providing the data necessary for marketers to personalize their communications effectively.What can I do to replace my cookies?With each iteration on more stringent privacy-related changes comes a wave of workarounds or alternate approaches to maintaining access to behavioral data essential to marketing:1. Deploy a strong first-party identification strategy.There is no replacement then a strong identification strategy. Creating a relationship in which a user will openly share their identity through a login or some other authenticated means will always result in the highest level of certainty on identity, which leads to the best level of personalization. However, many use cases focus on anonymous users or users who have not built up the relationship necessary to unlock this level of authentication.2. First-party client-side cookies have changed but are still a viable solution.Though third-party cookies are effectively dead, first-party cookies are still viable for many use cases. Not only do they offer a very simple off-the-shelf type of implementation for leveraging, they also have a long shelf life, assuming that an anonymous user interacts frequently enough to overcome the 7-day expiration window.3. First-party server-side cookies offer an extended expiration window.Over the past 12 months, there has been a surge of interest in server-side cookies. This method for setting cookies currently is not affected by the ITP changes that impact client-side cookies, most notably the automatic expiration at seven days. Rather, server-side cookies can live for long periods, leading to a higher quality identification for anonymous users. The downside, however, is they are far more difficult to leverage than the client-side. They require a much more technical integration with whatever server-side technology is used to power the web asset and may not be accessible in the same manner as client-side cookies.Getting Technical with Server Side CookiesIn general, regardless of the specific attribute settings used when leveraging server-side cookies, they currently are not impacted by the 7-day expiration window that client-side cookies fall victim to. However, Apple has made it clear that they have additional plans to extend some of the client-side cookie limitations to the server-side, and the most important attribute in that discussion is theHttpOnlyattribute.https://webkit.org/blog/9521/intelligent-tracking-prevention-2-3/As a CDP and technology leader, we always aim to help our customers future-proof their implementations. As such, even though a non-HttpOnly server-side cookie offers an easier means to bypass current client-side restrictions, it is our recommendation to consider investing to leverageHttpOnlycookies set by the server-side to prevent any potential impacts of the next few iterations of ITP. Below we’ll explore the two options and",

    "content": "Cloud Connect Data ModelsA Data Model is used by Cloud Connect to link or \"connect\" a user's external data warehouse to Lytics profiles. Each Data Model represents a set of records defined by a SQL query. Each Data Model will also configure a join key which defines how the Data Model is joined to Lytics Profiles.Once a Connection to your data warehouse has been created, Data Models can be created via theData Modelstab within the navigation bar:Creating a Data ModelClick+ Create Newfrom the Data Models dashboard and complete the following steps.Select the Connection.Write the SQL query.Query Editor: Write and test standard SQL queries directly in Lytics. Alternatively, copy and paste queries you've tested in your BigQuery or Snowflake instance. When you clickTest Query, Lytics will return 10 sample records.Test the query and validate the results.Configure the Data Model.Name: Data Model nameDescription: The Description of the Data Model.Slug: The Data Model name that will be used in the membership and activation fields in the audience builder. It is important that the name chosen here makes sense for those building audiences in the tool. If no slug is selected, it will auto-populate using the model name.Primary Key: Select the data warehouse ID that will be used to match against profiles in Lytics.External Lytics Key: Select a Lytics user profile field that is a unique identifier to map to an identifier in your incoming data source.Activated Fields:Select the fields you want to bring into Lytics profiles for activation. Note that each data model can only include 25 columns as activated fields.Sync Frequency: Select a time interval to run the query on - this is also the frequency that your Lytics profiles will be updated. The beta options are currently every 1 hour to every 3 weeks.Create new Lytics profile: Check this box if you want to create new profiles in Lytics if a profile with a matching ID does not already exist in Lytics. If you do not select this check box, only users with matching IDs to the Data Model IDs will be updated.Activate the Model. Until the Data Model is activated, its SQL query will not be run against your data warehouse and Lytics profiles will not be updated with the selected fields.📘When building multiple Cloud Connect Data Models with the same primary key, you must select the same External Lytics Key mapping. Selecting a different Lytics key will result in an error when you try to save the new Data Model.Example Use CaseConsider this scenario to demonstrate why you'd want to create a Cloud Connect Data Model driven audience instead of a standard Lytics audience. Your company sells e-bikes and wants to run a holiday campaign that sends a promotion to any customer who purchased an e-bike in November or December last year. Perhaps you also want to refine your audience to those who are interested in particular bike brands. All of this purchase and product data already exists in your Google BigQuery instance (as shown below).Instead of directly importing all that purchase history data into Lytics, you can write a SQL query to find which customers meet this audience criteria. By copying this query directly into the Lytics Model Builder (as shown in the generate a query screenshot above), you'll create a new audience in Lytics that will be updated on the frequency interval you decide.Once the Data Model is activated, profiles will be updated with a membership field that can be used to create an audience. Activated fields can be added to the Data Model that can then be used for more dynamic audiences.SQL TranslatorIf you would like to skip having to write a SQL query, simply describe the Data Model of what you wish to fetch and using GenAI, Lytics will translate the description to a SQL query for you. Lytics makes queries to your database to ensure that the data is up to date and accurate when creating the query.Updated2 months ago",

    "title": "User Profiles",
    "url": "https://docs.lytics.com/docs/understanding-user-profiles",
    "content": "IntroductionUser profiles provide relevant insights about individual customers in relation to your entire customer base. Referencing a user profile helps answer questions about who your customers are and how they are engaging with your brand.Initially, the user profile offers a way to test your Lytics implementation and validate the outcomes of your marketing tactics. For example, you can check if campaigns are working as expected by using a “test” persona and seeing how the user profile data gets updated.As you get deeper into building campaigns, the user profile provides insight into how your marketing influences user behaviors. For example, if you run a mobile campaign, you can drill down to see if customers are engaging on mobile devices, what days and times they are most active, and what types of content they are affinity for. User profiles are updated in real-time, but there can be a delay while the data is being processed and scores are being calculated for behavior and content affinity.To provide quick access to customer data, the user profile is divided into three tabs:Intelligence,Audiences, andDetails.Anatomy of a User ProfileIntelligenceThe intelligence tab gives a snapshot of key information about an individual user. At the top, a bar is displayed to help you quickly understand user engagement across all channels:Likelihood to re-engage,Current engagement level, andFrequency of user interactions.Each of these boxes summarizes the data science-powered behavioral scores into practical terms. The individual behavior scores and the user’s content affinity are displayed below. This rich data based on a user’s actual behavior is available thanks to the predictive analytics built into Lytics.Recent activity by channelThis module gives an overview of which channels (email, web, mobile, etc.) an individual user has been active in. When appropriately mapped, it will also provide information on when users were active on each channel (within the last day or within the last 30 days).NOTE: If this module is empty, please see below for details on how to configure the user fields. As with all data mapping exercises, it is best to include your Customer Success representatives for optimal results.How the recent activity by channel is managedIf you are customizing LQL or handling custom streams, it is important to understand how this module should be configured. For all our built-in integrations, Lytics includes this data mapping by default.At its core, the \"Recent activity by channel\" module is built from a single user field. This field will not exist in legacy accounts and must be added to the existing LQL manually. For all new accounts that get the latest default LQL files, the baseline should be included.In order to handle either custom data mapping for an account or backfill an old account, the user fieldlast_channel_activitiesmust be defined in a streams LQL file. This field is defined as amap[string]timeand should not be altered.In each stream you'll simply map a string, such as \"web\" or \"email\" to a timestamp such asepochms()in order to update the field. A more lengthy example for an email LQL might look something like:-- Profile Support\nmap(\"email\", epochms())    AS last_channel_activities    IF eq(tolower(action), \"open\") OR eq(tolower(action), \"click\")    SHORTDESC \"Last Activity By Channel\"    KIND map[string]timeThe example above is for when you only want to map the activity event in the case of a click or open. This definition will vary from stream to stream.When it comes to which keys to use, we recommend following these standards for common channels:emailadwebmobilesupportUnique identifiersHighlights the identifiers that have been used to materialize this particular user's profile.Event chartThe event chart shows a user’s activity by hour and day of the week. The top right of the chart highlights when a user is most active, for example Tuesdays at 10am.Audience MembershipThis tab displays a list of all the current Audiences a user belongs to and the total size of each audience. Audiences include factual information such as “Has Email Address” and “Known Location” along with Lytics score-driven characteristics such as “Deeply Engaged” or “Binge User”.Profile DetailsThe details tab gives an under-the-hood display of the exact user fields contributing to a user’s behavioral data and their audiences. Unique identifiers are shown first, which are essential for enabling cross-channel mapping. For all user fields, the associated stream and value is provided.Profile PictureSome profiles may include a profile picture when viewed in the user interface. This image comes fromGravatar. If the profile in question has an email address, Lytics converts it to an MD5 hash. That hash is then used to look up the corresponding image on Gravatar. This image is only displayed in the Lytics UI and is not part of the profile itself.Updatedalmost 2 years ago",

    "content": "IntroductionAudiences are central to creating personalized marketing using Lytics. It is how groups of users get targeted and defines how cross-channel user data is used in campaigns. Lytics offers audiences as a tool that operates on user fields as well as other audiences. This provides the ability to craft audiences that target one user, every user, or any number in between.Lytics audiences are automatically kept up to date. As time passes, an audience that once targeted 500 users may grow to target 10,000. This is great if your audience is targeting engaged users who have shown interest in your upcoming product, but not so great if your audience targets users with outstanding support tickets. Lytics makes it easy to find these insights so your campaign strategies can be adjusted accordingly.Audiences can be used in Lytics Experiences, third-party ad campaigns, and tools like Google BigQuery for advanced reporting. When all of that isn’t enough, the Lytics APIs provide deep integrations with the Lytics platform.📘Access the audience builder from Lytics navigation menu by expanding theAudiencestab and clickingAudiences. Once on the Audiences page, click on the+ Create New Audiencebutton.Creating AudiencesBuilding new audiences allows you to target specific groups of your users. Why send the same email to your entire audience? Instead, send emails to distinct audiences with content that you know those users enjoy. Lytics gives you the ability to create audiences based on cross channel user data, behaviors and interests.Audiences can be built using existing audiences, user content affinity, your personalization campaigns, or by custom rules utilizing any user fields in your Lytics account. Create rulesets by combining multiple audiences and boolean logic to target users with as much or as little granularity as you require.Lytics updates your audiences automatically. Once an audience is built, users will join or leave whenever they match (or fail to match) the rules you have set. Export your audiences, often in real-time, to your integrated marketing tools giving you the power of Lytics however you engage with your users.📘Access the audience builder from Lytics navigation menu by expanding theAudiencestab and clickingAudiences. Once on the Audiences page, click on the+ Create New Audiencebutton.Building Audiences: Existing AudiencesTheExisting Audiencestab in the audience builder contains a list of all existing audiences and their size categorized by audience type such as characteristic. Characteristics are pre-built audiences pertaining to single user attributes such as location or behavior.Keep in mind that the audience sizes you see in this list arenotreal-time. They are updated every few hours for performance reasons. When creating or editing an audience, however, you will always see real-time numbers so that you can make precise decisions based on accurate data.You can use theFilter by Audience Typedrop-down to filter the list or use theSearchbox to quickly find an audience by name.Select an audience or characteristic to add it to the definition of the audience you are building or editing.Building Audiences: Content AffinityTheContent Affinitytab in the audience builder is used to add Affinity-based rules to your audience. SinceAffinitiesare agroup of related Topics, this allows you to effectively target users interested in several subjects or products.In the example above, we created a \"Lavender\" Affinity for an online beauty store, which includes 6 Topics such as \"lavender\", \"lavender lotion\", and \"lavender luxury.\" Instead of creating an audience with 6 rules (one per Topic), we just select our Lavender Affinity that contains those 6 Topics.Once you choose an Affinity for your audience, you will be able to select the range of affinity values. The histogram displays the distribution of user interest for the selected Affinity and is helpful to build an audience that has the desired size. By default, users withAny Affinityare selected. You can choose a built-in range by clicking any of theAffinitybuttons or, to set a custom range, use the slider to refine the range of users to target. As you change the range, the total number of users that fit the range is shown in the right column.As soon as you create an Affinity, Lytics start scoring users against it as they interact with your content or products. For active users, you can expect this number to start populating within a few days. For inactive users, it can take up to 2 weeks for them to be scored against an Affinity. So it's recommended that you create Affinities in advance of the audience needed for an Affinity-based campaign.Topic-Based AudiencesUnder theCustom Ruletab in the Audience Builder, you can find the existing audiences based on Topics in your content taxonomy. If you want to create new audiences based on a single Topic, you can do so as follows:Search for \"Topics\" in the Custom Rule tab of the Audience BuilderSelect the Topic of interest.Set the threshold according to the desired users' level of interest in that Topic.Once you hit \"Add Condition\", the custom rule for a Topic will look like this:Although Topics are still supported in the Audience Builder, we strongly recommend you use Affinities to build audiences for a more efficient workflow and more effective targeting.Inferred Content AffinitySome users may find a field namedInferred Content Affinitywhen trying to build affinity or topic based audiences. This field contains topics that a user could be interested in even though they may not have interacted with the topics directly. To learn more about how these inferrences are made, you can read about ourcontent taxonomy process. Note that topic affinity already includes this information, but this field contains only inferred affinity. We would also recommend not using this field to build audiences as it is not a wholistic view of a user's affinity.Building Audiences: Custom RulesTheCustom Rulestab in the audience builder is used to add any rule based on auser fieldto the audience being built or edited.Custom rules allow for ultimate access of all data that is aggregated in user fields. Custom rules are simple statements that can be combined to create very precise audiences. Using them correctly requires a thorough understanding of the data being used, but there is no replacement for this level of segmentation.🚧Audiences Field Value LimitsAudiences can have a maximum of 1,000 field values. \"Values\" in this context apply to a single evaluation against a user field.When exceeded, the error message \"Audience too large! Remove values to save this audience\" will be displayed. For example, the following scenarios would trigger the alert:An audience with a single rule that supports multiple values ( e.g. contains one of) with 1001+ values.An audience with 1001+ user field rules each with a single evaluation (e.g. exists).Any variation in between such as two rules each containing over 500 evaluations, etc.The user field list displays all the fields in your account. TheSourcedrop-down can be used to filter on the data stream the user field came from. TheIncludesdrop-down can be used to filter user fields on the percentage of users that have a field. Use theSearchinput to search for a user field by name.Generally, to add a Custom Rule to an audience definition:Choose a User FieldChoose an operator (e.g., text contains, value is less than)Choose a valueThere are variations to this general procedure based on thetypeof the user field and the operator chosen.User Field TypesHow you work with user fields in the Custom Rules tab will depend on way the field is mapped in on the user profile.Numeric User FieldsNumeric user fields are most commonly used for data that is counted. For instance, the number of times a visitor has been to a website or the number of times a subscriber has opened an email. Exact values can be matched, but more commonly, inequalities are expressed.Examples:Total Number of ",

To install, visit theprimary extension pageand follow the instructions.Pin Extension to Nav Bar:Once installed, we recommend pining the extension to your top bar for easy access.Getting StartedOnce the extension is installed, you can visit any website where Lytics is or should be installed and begin debugging.Enable the extension: To activate the Lytics Dev Tools extension, open the extension and toggle the slider at the top right of the extension to either \"Enable\" or \"Disable.\"Verify Installation:The extension will verify that the Lytics tag has been installed successfully before further debugging. This is confirmed by the \"Lytics JavaScript SDK Installed\" alert displayed on the dashboard of the extension.Navigation:Once enabled, you'll access three key sections: Debugger, Profile, and Personalization, each offering specific functionalities tailored to streamline your debugging and exploration process.DebuggerThe debugger section of the extension serves multiple purposes. Firstly, as we did previously, it allows you to validate installation, ensuring that the Lytics tag is successfully implemented. Additionally, it provides access to the full active configuration of the JavaScript SDK through the configuration tab. Moreover, it includes a live event debugger that monitors and displays comprehensive details of any calls made to the Lytics APIs in real time. This feature is particularly valuable for reviewing data sent viajstag.sendcalls, offering insights into the interaction between your website and Lytics APIs.ProfileIn the \"Profile\" section of the extension, users gain a live look at the current visitor's profile, providing valuable insights into their browsing behavior and demographic information. This section offers a snapshot of key details, such as the visitor's unique identifier and behavioral scores, allowing for a quick assessment of their engagement level. Additionally, users can access a detailed view of all information available to the browser, including demographic data, past interactions, and any custom attributes stored in the visitor's profile. This comprehensive overview enables users to tailor their strategies and personalize experiences based on individual visitors' specific characteristics and preferences.PersonalizationIn the \"Personalization\" section of the extension, users gain access to a log of all active Lytics experiences and campaigns, along with their associated details. This feature proves invaluable when debugging the configuration of experiences or ensuring that overrides have produced the expected results. Users can easily track the performance and behavior of each personalized element on their website by providing a comprehensive overview of active campaigns and experiences, including their parameters and settings. This functionality streamlines debugging and empowers users to fine-tune their personalization strategies for optimal effectiveness.Updatedabout 1 year ago",

Learn how you can via the Lytics taghere.Options for sending data from Adobe to Lytics:From Adobe send data to a Lytics Supported data warehouse  (Google BigQuery,Microsoft Azure,Snowflake,Amazon Web Services (AWS) Redshift). The data from the data warehouse can be imported into Lytics. In many cases this is the recommended approach to avoid duplication of processes and data storage.Sending file based data from Adobe to Lytics using aLytics File ServiceClient Side - Using the Lytics JavaScript Tag [link] to pass Information to Lytics from the website / data layerFurther details on integrating with Adobe productsAdobe CampaignLytics can export file based data to Adobe Campaign via hourly/daily CSV file export to an SFTP location. Adobe Campaign can import CSV files from its own secure location. This is more of a limitation on the Adobe Campaign side regarding limited API access.Adobe AnalyticsThere are many ways to get data into Lytics from Adobe Analytics. One common method is to use the Lytics Javascript tag (jstag.send) function to send eVars directly from the data layer into Lytics on page load. This method will simplify the onboarding process and minimize the need to do a data transfer from Adobe Analytics on a regular basis.As part of onboarding, we can help identify which data you would like to pull in for activation and identify the right mechanisms for ingestion. Lytics provides ways to ingest this data from scheduled SFTP pickups to Bulk API imports or transactional APIs.Adobe TargetOur Javascript Tag will communicate user audience membership to Adobe Target, which will respond with the appropriate site personalizations.  This Lytics data will be returned from our platform on page load and the Users Profile, segmentation information and content recommendations will be placed in the web page data layer.You can pass this information simply by leveraging the lio.data.segments object that is loaded onto every page where the Lytics JS tag is deployed.Adobe Ad CloudSimilar to other Adobe products, Adobe Ad Cloud supports the consumption of user audiences via SFTP, Json file upload, API (Lytics can create a webhook to stream data - but more conversation with Adobe will be needed) as well as direct from other Adobe products like Adobe Audience Manager.Lytics can also directly send audiences from Lytics into ad platforms (e.g. Facebook, Google, Linkedin, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, LiveRamp.  With our Google partnership, Lytics has early access to Google’s API-based integration for custom audiences within DV360.Adobe Audience ManagerWe can deliver audiences into Audience Manager via SFTP or Data Warehouse integration, similar to how the above integrations have been documented.Updated2 months ago",

    "url": "https://docs.lytics.com/docs/insights",
    "content": "IntroductionLytics Insights provide visibility into how your audiences and campaigns perform and recommend how you may improve engagement, drive conversions, and increase marketing ROI.You can think of Lytics Insights as a way to connect thedatayou have with thedecisionsyou are making for marketing campaigns. Defined in a few words, Lytics Insights are:Actionable: Direct knowledge to your marketing initiatives.Contextual: Provide actions that are relevant to the Lytics user consuming them.Explanatory: Describe phenomena in terms of your business processes or outcomes.Novel: Offer a new understanding of your customers and campaigns.Insights serve as a key ingredient to achieve marketing personalization. To effectively leverage customer data, you must apply it throughout your campaign planning and execution process. Unlike metrics that remain on a BI dashboard or report, Lytics Insights are designed beimmediately activatedin your segmentation and campaign strategies.If your account package includes Insights, you can access Insights from anywhere in the Lytics UI.How Insights WorkInsights surface meaningful data and recommended action, enabling you to make better, data-driven decisions during your campaign planning and execution. The core idea behind Insights is simple. Insights are a combination of facts and actions:Fact: Observable, data-driven information providing demonstrable value. This is a unique set of raw metrics, such as the number of users or the amount of lift.Action: Suggested behavior based on user role, data source, activation channels, industry, etc. This is the contextualization of a fact into something to be done.Insights are made possible thanks to the data science capabilities built into Lytics. The heavy lift of processing and interpreting data is automatically handled by machine learning models under-the-hood.This is a prime example of how machine learning can augment (not replace) a marketer’s role. Machines efficiently and accurately sift through lots of data, allowing people to then make use of the important information in the most relevant context. For example, a model can predict which users are most likely to churn, and a marketer can then target those at-risk users with a win-back campaign on Facebook.Insight CardsInsights are presented asInsight Cardsthat are available throughout the entire app.Simply navigate to the left-hand side of the Lytics UI to open theInsights Drawer, which contains a list ofInsight Cardsunique to your account.Below is an example of an Insight card and what it's comprised of:Creation date: When the Insight was generated.Expiration date: When the Insight will be removed from the drawer. Insights expire after 2 weeks.Insight statement: The explanation or comparison of noteworthy data will depend on the type of Insight. You can click on an audience name to view its summary report.Recommended action: Lytics will suggest how you can apply this Insight to your targeting along with a related use case.Expanded definition: View more details by clicking the arrow. This example explains the Lytics score or other data field being calculated.Insights are generated and refreshed on aweekly basisto ensure you are viewing the most recent user data. Insights expire after 2 weeks, so you only target and activate an audience and campaigns during a relevant time frame.The Insights Drawer will display a maximum of 25 cards at a time. Insights will be created for up to10 custom audiences, in addition to Lytic's out-of-the-box engagement audiences. Lytics will prioritize Insights based on the statistical significance of the data and the most frequently used audiences.Compositional InsightsCompositional Insights help you understand the makeup of your audiences. This information can answer, “what makes an audience unique?” and “How should I target these users differently?”Compositional Insights make it easier for you to create effective segmentation strategies. They compare data fields within audiences to surface which attributes drive user behavior. Compositional Insights currently include the following:Audience PairsThis Insight compares high-value audiences on their levels of engagement. This can take the form of comparing Lytic's out-of-the-box audiences on a particular behavioral score or a custom audience.As a bite-size piece of information, this Insight Card has provided:An easy way to leverage Lytics audiences and scores that are derived from data science.A suggested next step of what to do with this information. For example, you may target these at-risk users with a win-back campaign.Field CandidatesThis Insight compares the prevalence of specific data fields within two audiences. Candidates included arefields used in audience definitionsand fields from thePromoted Schema Fieldsin yourAccount Settings.Having a granular understanding of your audiences allows you to make more strategic targeting decisions. For example, there may be a data field that your organization is paying to collect. If you discover through an Insight Card that this field is not performing as expected in your campaigns, you could save marketing spend by eliminating that field and using others that are shown to be more predictive of user behavior.Experience InsightsExperience Insights help you track and understand campaign performance. This information can answer, “Which campaigns are resonating with my users?” and “Are my marketing tactics driving engagement or conversions?”Experience Insights allow you to refine campaigns based on current metrics proactively. Since Lytics Insights are generated and refreshed every week, you can take action to improve a campaign while it’s running.Experience Insights include the following types:Experience ManagementThis Insight will surface when an experience is missing UTM parameters, which enable Lytics to track conversions from downstream tools such as Facebook.While this Insight is more straightforward than the other types Lytics offers, it helps you quickly identify when an Experience configuration is incomplete, affecting your ability to track performance and target users who have previously engaged in future campaigns.Experience PerformanceThis Insight appears when a significant spike up or down in campaign performance exists. Awareness of such incidents allows you to make the necessary changes to improve campaign ROI.For example, if conversion rates have rapidly declined for a particular campaign in the last week, you may need to reevaluate and consider changes such as refining your audience, messaging, or campaign tactics.Activating InsightsTaking action based on your Insights is the most important part of the process. As the introduction explains, Lytics Insights are designed to be actionable. By understanding how users interact with your brand at a granular level, you can iterate campaigns to improve their performance and deliver better user experiences.Activating against Lytics Behavioral ScoresUser engagement is a crucial component of personalization. Each Lytics Score (quantity, frequency, recency, intensity, momentum, propensity) indicates a different aspect of user behavior,  but overall, higher scores indicate high engagement, while lower scores indicate low engagement.Below are some everyday use cases you might consider, depending on whether the target audience hashigherbehavioral scores (anything above 50) orlowerbehavioral scores (anything below 50).Targeting Users with Low EngagementThere are two main approaches to reaching unengaged users. The first is to drive engagement using a variety of tactics, such as messaging on different channels, targeting based on content affinities, etc. The second approach is to increase marketing efficiency by suppressing these users, thus improving your conversions.Targeting Users with High EngagementWhen creating strategies around your most active users, you will want to keep them engaged by delivering relevant content and establishing a first-party relat",

    "title": "Importing External Experiences",
    "url": "https://docs.lytics.com/docs/importing-external-experiences",
    "content": "Importing External ExperiencesYou can import existing marketing initiatives currently managed by your channel providers, which enables you to quickly gain insights about the campaigns you’re already running. You can then take action by connecting these Experiences to your Lytics audiences.While you can monitor Experiences and activate audiences for them within Lytics, the management of external Experiences still happens inside your channel tools. If you want to stop, delete, or edit the execution of an Experience, you need to do so within the provider. If you choose to delete an Experience in Lytics that still has a matching campaign in your channel tool, it will show up on the import list and can be re-imported.Centralize cross-channel reportingLytics serves as a central hub to monitor your cross-channel marketing, making it easier to understand and improve the performance of  your campaigns. For example, instead of logging into Facebook to check your ad campaign metrics and Iterable to check your email newsletter open rates, you can monitor the performance of both tools within your Lytics dashboard.To start monitoring external Experiences on Lytics, follow the batch import steps.Monitor Experiences via batch importOn your Lytics dashboard, navigate toExperiences, and selectAdd Experiences > Import.Select your providerThe Lytics Canvas connects out-of-the-box with select channel providers. Over time, more providers will be added to this list. If you want to use a provider that is not currently available, you can use the \"Generic Experience\" workflow to export Lytics audiences to any of your integrated providers.AuthorizeNext, you will be prompted to select an authorization for your chosen provider. Existing authorizations will be shown. If you have multiple accounts within a particular channel such as Facebook, you will choose which account to import from. If you don’t have an authorization, you will be prompted to add one before continuing. For Facebook, there is a second step for authorizing Ad Set ID after you’ve selected your account ID.Import ExperiencesFinally, select the Experiences you want to import into Lytics (up to 10 at a time). The total number of Experiences you can bring into Lytics is only limited by the amount in your connected provider. However, to have meaningful and accurate reporting, it's recommended to only import Experiences that will add value to your use cases.Completed experiences, such as an Ad Set that previously \"ended\", will not show on the list of importable Experiences. But if you have Ad Sets in Facebook that are saved as drafts, paused, or currently running, those will be available to import.Connect Experiences with Lytics audiencesOnce you start monitoring external Experiences, you can activate them by adding a Lytics audience. This lets you enrich your existing campaigns with Lytics behavioral audiences, content affinities, and delivery optimization.An example use case is to conserve Facebook ad spend by only targeting “Currently Engaged” users who have a high affinity for the content of a particular campaign. Leveraging data science under the hood, Lytics audiences can bring immediate value to your existing marketing campaigns.If you have already imported an external Experience, you can activate it from the Experience summary view by clickingEditin the top right.If you want to activate an Experience that you haven't imported yet, follow the single import steps below, which will guide you through the Experience editor.Activate Experiences via single importTo activate an Experience that you haven't imported yet, you will follow the workflow of creating a new Experience in Lytics. From the Experiences list view, clickAdd Experiences>New.Select your chosen provider and thenImportthe campaign, ad set, or journey. This example will continue with importing a SendGrid campaign.Next you will select an Authorization for your chosen provider as described above.Then you will select the campaign or ad set to import. Note that here you can only import one Experience at a time. ClickImport 1 Experienceto continue.Complete the Experience Editor stepsFinally, you will complete the following Experience Editor steps:Target: configure your target audience for this Experience.Configure provider: choose how the audience for your Experience will be exported to the third-party tool.Configure delivery: option to automatically determine when to deliver messages to individual users on the third-party tool.Upon completion, your Experience will be ready to publish.Updatedalmost 2 years ago",

    "title": "IDP-initiated SSO (legacy)",
    "url": "https://docs.lytics.com/docs/idp-initiated-sso-legacy",
    "content": "IDP-initiated SSO (Legacy)🚧This document describes a legacy implementation that Lytics is actively deprecating. If you're looking for details on the current SSO implementation, check out thenew documentation.Lytics supports enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) by usingAuth0as a service provider usingSAML protocol. Lytics integrates with Identity Providers (IdPs) in such a way that the IdP initiates SSO. That is, when your end user logs in to their IdP, they will use a global portal for your organization. Users can then click a link or button that will log them into Lytics seamlessly.Behind the scenes, the IdP will be contacting the Lytics Auth0 service provider to verify the user and redirect them to a logged-in instance of the Lytics app. This document describes the process for integrating with a new IdP that uses SAML.Service Provider ConfigurationTo configure SAML for the Lytics service provider some information is required about your IdP. If you have a metadata file that contains SAML provider information this may be appropriate, just make sure that the following information is provided toLytics Support:Sign In URLX509 Signing Certificate (The identity provider public key - if possible encoded in a separate PEM or CER formatted file)Sign Out URLFurther configuration details such as mappings may need to be provided. Once this information has been received, Lytics can configure the SAML connection in Auth0.IdP ConfigurationAfter Lytics configures the SAML connection on the service provider,Lytics Supportwill provide a metadata XML file with the following information in order to complete the IdP configuration. The key fields in this metadata are:Connection NameAssertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL (aka post-back or callback URL)Entity ID of the Service ProviderWith this information, your IdP connection can be configured to complete the SSO integration.Testing SSOOnce all the information has been configured in both the IdP and the Lytics service provider, you can test and verify that the SSO implementation works as expected. If you are using SSO as your only sign-in method, please disable any password restriction or expiration settings that may have been enabled in the UI.During the testing process, Lytics can be configured to allow both SSO logins and regular username and password (or Google OAuth) login through the app. This allows users to test SSO without disrupting the day-to-day usage of the app.If requested, once the SSO implementation has been tested and verified, Lytics can disable the use of other logins for an account.Troubleshooting SSOIf it's known that SSO is going to be added to an account, then the user email addresses added to the account should match the email address present within the IdP. If the email address doesn’t match, then the login will fail as Lytics will not be able to verify that there is a user with that email address.For instance, if the email listed in the IdP isabc@123, and within Lytics it’sdef@456, then the user will have successfully been verified by their IdP, but the login within Lytics would fail as the authenticated user email would not match the user within Lytics. You would need to create a new user within Lytics with the email addressabc@123for the SSO login to be successful.It should also be noted that primary accounts are decided as the first account that a user was added to.  Due to this,  users from a single group/organization will often have different primary accounts. This is important for SSO as it will also be the account that the user is logged into at the start of their session. If SSO is enabled as the only means of login on one account and a user attempts to log-in using Google OAuth or their username and password, the login session will fail. The following options are possible solutions:Add that user to your IdP.Other methods of logging in would need to be added (Google OAuth, username/password).Remove user from all accounts and then add them back with the first account being the account that you want to be their primary account.Lytics Supportcan assist in the troubleshooting process. When testing for the first time Lytics can enable logging to help troubleshoot any issues you may encounter. If you are receiving the error message shown below after being redirected to the app, that means there is an issue on the application side.TheLytics Supportteam can help debug this if you provide information on the login attempt such as the time of the login and the user and account.If you’re encountering an error earlier in the login process, such as before you are redirected to the Lytics app, this may be an issue with the SAML configuration either on the IdP or Service provider side. Lytics’ support team can review these issues and coordinate a fix, just contact us with the details of the issue.Updatedalmost 2 years ago",

    "content": "TL;DRThis document outlines how to leverage Lytics' real-time personalization engine to identify visitors who lack the strong identifiers necessary to link web-based behavioral insights with other activation channels such as email.BackgroundWhat is lead capture?Traditionally, lead capture involves gathering information from individuals interested in your products or services, such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers. This occurs when people visit your website, subscribe to your newsletter, download resources, or interact with your content. However, in recent years, the role of lead capture within your global consumer engagement strategy has undergone significant transformation.Why is it important?Accurate measurement of attribution and conversions is paramount to assessing the effectiveness of your marketing efforts.With the challenges posed by the deprecation of third-party cookies, particularly impacting top-of-funnel ad campaigns, lead capture becomes a crucial data collection and targeting strategy.In an era of short attention spans, every interaction must be hyper-relevant and efficient, making lead capture instrumental in delivering personalized content.As marketing budgets face constraints, each dollar spent must yield maximum potential, and lead capture aids in optimizing resource allocation.Building comprehensive consumer profiles representing behavioral patterns over time is essential to get the most out of the latest advancements in AI.See it in action.Lytics' real-time personalization engine lets you first identify the current web visitor, programmatically review their profile, and ultimately decide if a campaign should be delivered to their browser to close gaps in that profile.InstructionsBelow, you'll find a detailed guide on how to execute this use case. At the end, you'll find additional reading, which will help you learn how to extend and customize this use case further.RequirementsHave access to an active Lytics account.Ability to add JavaScript to your website via tag manager or CMS.Entry-level knowledge of JavaScript. (Don't worry; it is mostly \"copy and paste\" here.)Install Lytics Core SDKBefore executing this use case, your website must be properly configured with the core Lytics SDK (JavaScript tag). Please refer to ourinstallation documentationto confirm the tag is present before continuing.Activate Required AttributesAs an admin user of Lytics, you canenable or disable any attributesfrom being surfaced to the web via our JavaScript SDK. Depending on how your account has been configured, you may need to allow some of the required attributes for this particular use case.Required Attributes:Attributeanonymous_profilesThis computed attribute, available by default in all accounts, represents visitors who do not yet have a strong identifier, such as an email address.known_profilesThis computed attribute, available by default in all accounts, represents visitors with strong identifiers such as email addresses.Configure Web ExperienceTo execute this use case, we will launch a simple lead capture form at the bottom left of your site. The lead capture will focus on collecting email addresses for the user and use a generic \"dark\" theme along with some boilerplate messaging. For best results, we recommend leveraging an offer of some sort that will resonate with your customers to entice them to \"sign up\" and identify themselves. In return, you'll gain much knowledge about this visitor, strengthen your consumer record, and unlock the ability to connect in channels outside of just the web.JavaScript<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  jstag.on('pathfora.publish.done', function(topic, event){\n\n    var module = new pathfora.Form({\n      id: 'lead-capture-form',\n      layout: 'slideout',\n      theme: 'dark',\n      headline: 'Sign up!',\n      msg: 'Submit this form to get updates',\n      formElements: [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"email\",\n          \"required\": true,\n          \"label\": \"Email\",\n          \"name\": \"email\"\n        }\n      ]\n    });\n\n    var modules = {\n      target: [{\n        segment: \"anonymous_profiles\",\n        widgets: [module]\n      }]\n    };\n\n    pathfora.initializeWidgets(modules);\n  });\n</script>Bonus IdeaYou can extend this use case to progressively improve your visitor profiles by surfacing data capture forms specific to gaps in their profile data. For instance, when they are unknown, only ask for email. As soon as you have an email, perhaps you want to know more about their preferences or learn how to improve a particular portion of your product/offering.Configure ReportingThe Lytics platform has a pre-defined schema to facilitate this use case. As such, we recommend building acustom reportfrom within our UI to showcase your progress in converting unknown or anonymous visitors to known visitors with a strong identifier. There are many ways to configure this type of reporting, but here we'll guide you through a basic example to measure impact.Create New ReportAdd Anonymous vs. Known \"Size\" ComponentStep 1:Once you have created your new report, add a component using the \"+ Add New Component\" button at the top of the report.Step 2:Select \"Size\" as your component type.Step 3:Name your component. We recommend something simple like \"Anonymous vs. Known\".Step 4:Add an optional description to explain the goal of this report to ease the consumption for others later.Step 5:Select the audiences you'd like to highlight. In this use case, we'll select \"Anonymous Profiles\" and \"Known Profiles\", which are both available by default.Step 6:Save your component. Please note it may take some time for the report to populate once you have configured it, but as long as you see the empty \"Not enough data\" state, you are good to go.Add Impression \"Composition\" ComponentStep 1:Following steps similar to the previous component, we'll add another component, but this time, we use the \"Composition\" component type.Step 2:Name your component \"Campaign Impressions,\" as this component will focus on showcasing impression information to validate that the campaign is being shown.Step 3:Select the \"All\" audience to ensure all visitors, regardless if they are known or unknown, are included in the report.Step 4:Select the field \"ly_impressions.\" This field represents an array of all campaigns each visitor has interacted with and is available by default. The values returned for custom campaigns will match the \"ID\" you set above in the campaign configuration.Step 5:Finally, replace \"my_campaign_id\" in the example below with the ID of your campaign above to highlight only interactions for that campaign.Add Conversion \"Composition\" ComponentFollowing the same steps as above, configure another \"Composition\" component, but this time, use the field \"ly_conversions\" as it will be an array of all campaigns your users have converted on instead of the impressions used previously.Thats it. Your report has been configured. As you begin to gain impressions and conversions, this report will populate. Generally, every hour or two, to highlight the impact.Bonus!Get additional guidance on how to pass interaction information related to your campaign to the following common sources for additional reporting and insight discovery:Google Analytics [coming soon]Custom BI via Data Warehouse [coming soon]Execute Your ExperienceOnce you have configured and tested your Experience, activation is as simple as publishing the JavaScript code to your site. This may be done via a tag manager like Google Tag Manager or using another mechanism such as Drupal blocks or WordPress.Updated12 months ago",

    "content": "TL;DRThis document details the process of utilizing Lytics' real-time personalization engine to showcase content that resonates with a visitor's interests. This can be implemented directly inline or through a pop-up modal on your website to boost engagement.BackgroundHow does Lytics make content recommendations?Lytics Interest Engines provides a sophisticated approach for businesses to gain and leverage insights into which content is most likely to resonate based on behavioral patterns. This is achieved through a detailed enrichment and affinity generation process in real-time. While full details are available in Lytics' comprehensive documentation, the core process can be distilled into four key steps:Tracking Interactions: Monitoring visitor behavior in real-time to understand their engagement with the site.Content Analysis & Topic Extraction: Using Google NLP and proprietary algorithms, Lytics automatically analyzes all the content on your website, translating it into a detailed topic graph.Interest Scoring: Assigning scores to reflect a visitor's level of interest in different topics, updated dynamically as new interactions occur.Content Recommendation: Suggesting content that aligns with the visitor's demonstrated interests, leveraging real-time insights for timely and relevant engagement.This streamlined framework enables real-time personalization, enhancing user experience by continuously adapting to evolving visitor interests.Why is it important?Relevant content for individual users boosts marketing effectiveness and ROI by increasing engagement and conversion rates. Personalized content meets users' interests, leading to better resource utilization and higher customer retention. This targeted strategy enhances sales opportunities and brand perception, directly improving return on investment.See it in action.Lytics' real-time personalization engine lets you first identify the current web visitor, programmatically review their profile, and deliver one or more pieces of content based on their unique interests to maximize engagement.InstructionsBelow, you'll find a detailed guide on how to execute this use case. At the end, you'll find additional reading, which will help you learn how to extend and customize this use case further.RequirementsHave access to an active Lytics account.Lytics account must have had enough time to build the topic graph. Typically, 24 to 48 hours.Ability to add JavaScript to your website via tag manager or CMS.Entry-level knowledge of JavaScript. (Don't worry; it is mostly \"copy and paste\" here.)Install Lytics Core SDKBefore executing this use case, your website must be properly configured with the core Lytics SDK (JavaScript tag). Please refer to ourinstallation documentationto confirm the tag is present before continuing.Interest Scores & Content CollectionsYour content must be classified before Lytics can offer content recommendations or insights. Typically, this classification process takes 24 to 48 hours, though it may extend if your catalog is particularly large. To ensure the health of your content graph and interest engines, there are a few key areas to focus on:Verify Interest Scores on ProfileEnsure the Lytics Developer Tools Chrome extension is installed and Enabled.Visit the domain(s) that have the Lytics JavaScript SDK installed.Open the Chrome extension and navigate to theProfilesection at the bottom.From theSummarytab, you will see a section labeledInterests. Here, we will list any topics and their associated level for the user. If your user gets a message \"No interests are available,\" proceed to the next step to ensure content has been classified.Verify Content has Been Classified📘If you have not already verified the quality of classification and metadata, please refer to ourquickstart documentation.From the Lytics interface, navigate toDecision Enginefrom the product switcher at the top left.Using the left-hand menu, navigate toContent>Collections.From the list of collections, there is likely only one; look forAll Contentin the list and the rowsSize. This refers to the number of documents classified; it should be greater than one and reflect your total catalog.For greater detail, you can also visitContent>Web Classification.At the top of that page will be a summary dashboard of all content that has been successfully classified and cataloged. Most notably, theAll Documentscount under theURL Pathcomponent.Troubleshooting Common ProblemsI have nolytics_content_enrichstream. (coming soon)My content is not showing up at all. (coming soon)My content is being classified, but none of my documents have images. (coming soon)Select a content collection.We will use the default collection outlined below for this exercise, but you may also create a custom collection with a subset of your content to recommend.CollectionDescriptionall_contentThis collection contains all classified documents. It comes out of the box in all Lytics accounts.📘Ready to go a step farther and build a custom collection of your content to ensure recommendations are selected from a more currated set of documents? Check out our fulldocumentation.Activate Required Attributes & SegmentsAs an admin user of Lytics, you canenable or disable any attributesfrom being surfaced to the web via our JavaScript SDK. Depending on how your account has been configured, you may need to allow some of the required attributes for this particular use case.Required Attributes:SegmentDescriptionallWe will use the out-of-the-box segment containing all your site's users for demonstration. We recommend using something more refined in production, such as new or high-value visitors.Configure Web ExperienceTo execute this use case, we will demonstrate two examples. The first will be a single content recommendation in a popup style modal, while the second will leverage Pathfora to add a set of recommendations inline to your website.Example 1: Content Recommendation ModalJavaScriptHTMLjstag.on('pathfora.publish.done', function(topic, event){\n  var module = new pathfora.Message({\n    id: 'content-rec-sample',\n    layout: 'slideout',\n    theme: 'dark',\n    headline: 'Yummy content!',\n    msg: 'We suspect you are going to want to check this out.',\n    recommend: {\n      collection: 'all_content'\n    },\n    cancelShow: false,\n    okShow: false,\n    variant: 3\n  });\n\n  var modules = {\n    target: [{\n      segment: \"all\",\n      widgets: [module]\n    }]\n  };\n\n  pathfora.initializeWidgets(modules);\n});<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  jstag.on('pathfora.publish.done', function(topic, event){\n    var module = new pathfora.Message({\n      id: 'content-rec-sample',\n      layout: 'slideout',\n      theme: 'dark',\n      headline: 'Yummy content!',\n      msg: 'We suspect you are going to want to check this out.',\n      recommend: {\n        collection: 'all_content'\n      },\n      cancelShow: false,\n      okShow: false,\n      variant: 3 // this variant shows the title and image for the recommendations\n    });\n\n    var modules = {\n      target: [{\n        segment: \"all\",\n        widgets: [module]\n      }]\n    };\n\n    pathfora.initializeWidgets(modules);\n  });\n</script>Example 2: Inline Content RecommendationIn this example, we'll use a generic Drupal Block with pure HTML and CSS, but the same approach can be taken using WordPress or a third-party tag manager such as Google Tag Manager.HTML<style>\n    .rec-container {\n        display: flex;\n        justify-content: space-between;\n        width: 100%;\n    }\n\n    .rec-item {\n        box-sizing: border-box;\n        flex: 1;\n        padding: 10px;\n    }\n\n    .rec-title,\n    .rec-description {\n        font-size: 14px;\n        margin-bottom: 5px;\n        word-wrap: break-word;\n    }\n\n    .rec-description {\n        font-size: 12px;\n    }\n\n    .rec-img {\n        height: auto;\n        margin-bottom: 5px;\n        max-width: 100%;\n    }\n</style>\n<div class=\"rec-container\">\n    <div class=\"rec-item\" data-pfblock=\"lytics-recommend\" data-pfrecommend=\"all_c",

A System Event is simply a log of an action taken within the platform, whether it’s a user creating a job, segment, or role, or an error message indicating a job failure.Export vs. AlertLog Export: This is a job that either streams logs in real time or performs a batch export to an external source, such as a webhook or a data warehouse table.Log Alert: Alerts are triggered based on specified conditions and notify users when certain actions occur within the system.In both cases, the content of exports or alerts depends on the filters you set up. Filtering is typically done using theSubject(such as User, Segment, or Job) and theVerb(the action taken on the subject, like created, updated, deleted, or failed).Creating an Audit Log export (aka System Alert) Job via the UICreating a job to export your Audit and System Event logs is like creating any other job; for more information, seeData Pipeline-> Jobs.
